# CLI Programs: All Options Explained

It's easier to understand how to use various programs (`purs`, `pulp`, `bower`, `psc-package`) by reading through their docs a mind-map format rather than in a man-page-like format.

The following libraries have been documented in this manner:
- purs: `0.12.0`
- pulp: `12.3.0`
- psc-package: `0.3.2`
